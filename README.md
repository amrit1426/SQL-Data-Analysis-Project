## 🛠️ Project Setup & Execution (PostgreSQL + HeidiSQL)

Follow the steps below to run the entire project from scratch:

### ✅ Step 1: Create Database
Run the first SQL script:
- `1_create_database.sql`  
This script creates the main PostgreSQL database for the project.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create Tables
Run the second SQL script:
- `2_create_tables.sql`  
This script creates all required tables such as:
- `job_postings_fact`
- `skills_dim`
- `skills_job_dim`

- `company_dim`

---

### ✅ Step 3: Load CSV Data
Run the third SQL script:
- `3_modify_tables.sql`  
This script loads all CSV files into their respective tables using `COPY` or `\copy` commands.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Run Analysis Queries
After data is loaded, run the analysis SQL queries to generate insights such as:

1.	- What are the top-paying jobs for my role?
2.	- What are the skills required for these top-paying roles?
3.	- What are the most in-demand skills for my role?
4.	- What are the top skills based on salary for my role?
5.	- What are the most optimal skills to learn?
o	- Optimal: High Demand AND High Paying
- This step involves running five SQL scripts in this repo that correspond to the questions above:

- 1_top_paying_jobs

- 2_top_paying_job_skills

- 3_top_demanding_skills

- 4_top_skills_based_on_salary

- 5_most_optimal_skills

- Using these SQL scripts the databese has been explored and answer the project questions.
